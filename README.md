## Project Description
We propose a Health Monitoring system by developing a new Middleware based on IOTA ledger which would provide distributed data ledger which is suitable for resource constrained devices used in IoT networks. All the computations and communication will be carried out by the Middleware. This will reduce resource demand of IoT devices. Our Middleware will take 3-Layered Approach to solve the issues faced. In first layer of our system, there would be a Health Monitoring Device to measure patientâ€™s readings. There would be Android and Web Application which would act as interface sensors. Second layer is the main component of our solution, which is our Middleware. In second layer, we will provide easy integration of devices by using our Integration Module. There will be an ID Management Module which decides on permissioned devices. Device communication with IoTA will be carried out by Data Transmitter and Data Receiver Modules. We have IRI Node Module and Reverse Proxy Module Here. These modules will take over task of validating transactions and adding into ledger in the form of trytes as well as receiving trytes from IOTA ledger. Reverse Proxy Module will ensure protection against DDoS attacks by defining number of requests allowed to device for a specific time.
